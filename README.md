# KORUZA-ScientificExperiments
Raw measurements from scientific experiments. We are particularly intersted in FSO behaviour in fog and other conditions and thus conduct a number of experiments in our [50m long test chamber](http://irnas.eu/test-facility).

Measurements from the following expoeriments are currently in this repository:
 * [Fog particle size and FSO link attenuation with Malvern Spraytec instrument](http://irnas.eu/koruza/2016/11/10/fog-particle-size-and-fso-link-attenuation-with-malvern-spraytec-instrument)
